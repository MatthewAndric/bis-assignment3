    <h2>Angela Mao [s3857679] [s3779854@student.rmit.edu.au]</h2>
    <p>I have found that learning Unity’s interface and basic functions was not as hard as I thought as there are plenty of online resources that offer help into how to use it. It was unexpectedly not complicated and easy to learn as Unity simplified many of the tasks for me and was straightforward.</p>
    <p>The only thing I found difficult and being a huge obstacle would’ve been the Unity Teams feature of Unity. This feature allowed the group to collaborate on the same project through using a push and commit system, and it would sync with each instance of the project on our systems. However sometimes it found itself to be unreliable and buggy which added a level of difficulty for myself.</p>
    <p>The challenges I were expecting were going to be the eventual time and workload constraints as the semester went on, with other subjects and personal life to juggle. To address this, I tried as hard as possible to stick to the schedule of contributing some work every week. I had overcome this challenge by sticking to this schedule and successfully implementing features that helped keep me on top of things.</p>
    <p>Another challenge would be having trouble programming and knowing how to use unity, as I only have basic programming skills and C# was a whole new programming language to learn. I addressed this challenge with my previous programming knowledge and consulting tutorials on youtube and looking for help on google whenever I had trouble. I did this knowing Unity has a supportive community and many resources to accomplish tasks in Unity. With my research, I overcame the programming obstacle for this particular project.</p>
    <p>These two challenges stretched me as it meant I had to be more concise with my time management and research for long hours, sometimes with no beneficial outcome. However, hours spent on this project gave me experience in game development which made it well worth the time. </p>
    <p>Halfway into the development of the game, plans changed as someone in our group had withdrawn from the class, leaving us at a disadvantage. This meant that work would have to be increased among each member to accommodate for this change. Instead of focusing on one or two MVFs, I had to end up focusing on a third one as it tied heavily into one of my other MVFs I was working on. This resulted in changing the time allocated to each MVF and ultimately affected the quality of what was done. Some MVFs were cut short, for example, having a wider variety of enemy attacks.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, I probably would have just made less MVFs and workload and just tried to fit five MVFs that we would have spent most of our time on, so that the quality was better. I also would have made sprites as we finished per level, so we didn’t end up with extra unused sprites.</p>
    <p>I found the timetable to be unrealistic as in reality, I had put hours into working on MVFs that weren’t my own, which did not happen. I had only worked on my MVFs alone and left the other MVFs to the members that were in charge of them. However, the time put into the MVFs that I did were accurate.</p>
    <p>All of the tools and technologies that I used worked out as expected, except for Unity Teams as I mentioned earlier. Some project risks we had predicted that were encountered while working on the project were time restrictions and the final product not reflecting our intended vision (due to time constraints.)</p>

    <p>I have found it easy to search online resources to help me understand how to use the completely alien game engine, because Unity has been around for many years and there are so many tutorials on the internet. However, one unexpected thing is the frequency of the Unity ‘s version update. So, following the old version of Unity tutorial made me confused when I did not find some setting in a new version.The other unexpected things are the difficulties of collaborating with teammates if we are not using the same version and lots of issues came up when we committed the code to the game project. After we confirmed the version carefully, the problem was solved. That inspired me to pay more attention to what the Unity version is when I am looking for an online tutorial or collaborating with teammates, though I spent a bit of time on solving this problem.</p>
    <p>The challenges I was expecting were self learning lots of things including coding C# scripts and the concepts of the 2D game features may get lost sometimes. To address these, I watched a lot of youtube tutorials and learned the knowledge step by step, even though it is not related to the features assigned to me. Being patient is the essential capacity when facing difficulties. Also, my tutor Russul gave some useful advice during the weekly meetings, which helped me a lot. I remember that he encouraged me to start a game project with one level individually to implement my inventory system when I did not know how to implement my feature without other features support. I did it, and finally I successfully implemented the basic features of the inventory system and some related features.</p>
    <p>Game development is a completely new experience for me. Although I could not master Unity or 2D games in the limited few weeks, basically I can say I know the basic operation of Unity and the basic concepts of 2D platformer games. I think these experiences are very valuable which will be helpful for my future study in IT.</p>
    <p>Plans changed because of many reasons. The one is I did not have a clear estimation on how much time I would spend each week at the beginning of this semester, and I made a heavy workload timetable for me. The other one reason is that someone withdrew this course, which led our team harder to complete the tasks on time. Therefore, almost everyone in our team could not follow the original timetable after half of the semester. We can only try to do as much as possible, and we cut off some features.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, I think I would reduce the workload and start to develop the game earlier. If I do so, I would have more time to implement the features better and solve the unpredictable problems. I think timetable is unrealistic, no matter how we change the timetable, it would not be perfect, because we can not predict everything in the beginning of the semester. I think the better way is making a short term timetable like one or two week instead of the whole semester timetable.</p>
    <p>For our game project, we totally developed it on the Unity engine. Generally, it works as expected except for some small bugs. Though the game is not as good as we designed it to be, it is still a proof of team effort, I am satisfied with the final project.</p>
    
    <h2>Matthew Andric [s3506698] [s3506698@rmit.student.edu.au]</h2>
    <p>I had found that implementing the level itself could be made simple by using the tile layout in Unity, this fit our needs and creates a very simple way to design levels in the engine.</p>
    <p>I found that Unity itself with implementing features was a bit more difficult than anticipated as there could be some unexpected interactions that could cause issues, the engine itself is quite complicated behind the scenes so it requires a bit of research to implement things properly.</p>
    <p>I had expected Unity overall to be more straightforward but some issues here and there had shown me that it required more in depth knowledge to ensure everything was working as intended.</p>
    <p>I had gained more skills in Unity as well as some in creating simple spritework, the skills in Unity include both the tools included and programming some scripts.</p>
    
    <h2>Ziqiang Lin [s3792327] [s3792327@rmit.student.edu.au]</h2>
    <p>For this project to come up with ideas is not so hard. But implementing them is kind of difficult. There is always a collision between object and bug between code that is made by different people. The unexpected things are that if people are using different visions of Unity to work together, the code would not work properly when combining which can cause a lot of work to fix and a lot of code changing.</p>
    <p>Since the big part of the project is pure coding. I was expecting to spend a lot of time learning how to code with Unity. But I find that there are a lot of resources online for learning and also a documentation website that explains the function of the method and code.</p>
    <p>From the plan and timetable our group made before, I find it not so realistic to follow since the time to do each feature can vary depending on the element it relates to. And also throughout the semester, there are times when multiple assignments are due at the same time, this made the group focus less on the project. I think a better way to make a timetable would be to make adjustments every few meetings so everyone would have a rough idea of where the project is heading and make them not lost in what they need to work on.</p>
    <p>For this project, we use the Unity Team, which is not a very well designed function by Unity. Every time a team member makes a change in the project, for others to see that change usually requires multiple refreshes. And if others are not aware of the change, the stuff they commit would overlap and the application would only save the newest one. To address the issue, we keep communication when making any changes, which allow all the group members to understand what others are doing and what each code is for.</p>
    <p>From this project, I learn how to code with C# and more importantly how to work with a team remotely. Through the use of GitHub and Microsoft Teams, I learned how to share work with each other and how to communicate effectively when something needs to be done.</p>
